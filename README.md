- 👋 Hi, I’m @K3v3l3ctro

- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code to make apps, games, parental control type programs.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Linux Debian

- 💞️ IDK if anyone wants me to collab with them or not since I am such a SUPER noob with all of this! However,  I would cherish the opportunity to grow and learn. Please consider reaching out to me if there's anything I can do for you or your project(s)

- 📫 Drop a line to Kevelectro@gmail.com if you've any comment, questions, or concerns! 

- 👷‍♀️ Current projects I'm working on are an AI race assistant for Gran Turismo 4 on the MIST AMAZING PS2 emulator, PCSX2! Also, Im working on an OBD2 scanner. Both projects are of personal interest to me and very special being my first 2 solo projects!
